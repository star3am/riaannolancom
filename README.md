## About

I specialize in infrastructure automation and crafting state-of-the-art solutions. My role encompasses pre-sales POCs, MVPs, and productionizing Terraform and Vault Enterprise, alongside developing acceleration programs that bolster our delivery capabilities. With a strong focus on collaborative frameworks, and establishing Centres of Excellence (CoE) which involves identifying a specific area of expertise within an organization, gathering the best talent and resources related to that field, and creating a centralized hub to develop best practices, provide training, support implementation, and ultimately elevate the organization's capabilities in that area to a world-class level. 

As a HashiCorp Ambassador, my commitment to the community is exemplified through multiple years of significant contributions and knowledge sharing. I've established a reputation for excellence by crafting Hashiqube, a comprehensive DevOps lab, and by maintaining active participation in HashiCorp's events. My certifications in Terraform and Vault demonstrate a dedication to mastering technologies that drive efficiency and innovation in cloud infrastructure.

Currently, DevOps Tech Lead. Previously Lead DevOps, Head of DevOps Engineering, Director of DevOps, Principle Solutions Architect, Principle Consultant and HashiCorp Ambassador.

## Projects
<a href="https://hashiqube.com" target="_blank">__HashiQube__</a> <span style="color:#f1fa8c; font-weight:bold">A DevOps Development Lab running All HashiCorp products</span>

Hashiqube is a DevOps Lab in a Docker Container. Hashiqube has a Docker daemon inside meaning, we can run containers inside Hashiqube using Kubernetes (Minikube) or Nomad or Docker run. It runs all Hashicorp products. Vault, Terraform, Nomad, Consul, Waypoint, Boundary, Vagrant, Packer and Sentinel.

It also runs a host of other popular Open Source DevOps/DevSecOps applications (Minikube, Ansible AWX Tower, Traefik etc.) showcasing how simple integration with Hashicorp products can result in tangible learnings and benefits for all its users.

Once Hashiqube is up an internet connection is no longer needed meaning sales pitches and demos for potential and existing customers are greatly aided.

Hashiqube has been created to help Engineers, Developers and anyone who wants to practise, learn or demo HashiCorp products to get started quickly with a local lab.
