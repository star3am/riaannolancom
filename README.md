## Projects
<a href="https://hashiqube.com" target="_blank">__HashiQube__</a> <span style="color:#f1fa8c; font-weight:bold">A DevOps Development Lab running All HashiCorp products</span>

Hashiqube is a DevOps Lab in a Docker Container. Hashiqube has a Docker daemon inside meaning, we can run containers inside Hashiqube using Kubernetes (Minikube) or Nomad or Docker run. It runs all Hashicorp products. Vault, Terraform, Nomad, Consul, Waypoint, Boundary, Vagrant, Packer and Sentinel.

It also runs a host of other popular Open Source DevOps/DevSecOps applications (Minikube, Ansible AWX Tower, Traefik etc.) showcasing how simple integration with Hashicorp products can result in tangible learnings and benefits for all its users.

Once Hashiqube is up an internet connection is no longer needed meaning sales pitches and demos for potential and existing customers are greatly aided.

Hashiqube has been created to help Engineers, Developers and anyone who wants to practise, learn or demo HashiCorp products to get started quickly with a local lab.
