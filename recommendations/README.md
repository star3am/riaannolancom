Recommendations that I have received and given during my professional career. It's always such a feel good page for me, it brings back such fond memories :heart:

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### ** Given **
__Neda Divbandi__
*Senior Php developer and back end team lead*

`February 6, 2020, Riaan worked with Neda in different groups`

I have worked with Neda for about 2 years. When I she first started the company's Senior Developer just left, she had basically no hand over and did not know the project at all, it must have been quit stressful for her but to be completely honest Neda handled it so well!

Neda is soft natured, and very patient, and extremely knowledgeable. Neda fixed a TON of bugs! All while I was busy migrating the manuel AWS setup to Infrastructure as Code, with infra in Cloudformation and Configuration in Puppet.

Neda is a true gem, one of those people you can always count on, she is calm in times of high stress, and her colleagues respect and admire her. I would recommend Neda to any company that respects and nurture and support their employees.

I wish you only the best dear Neda, thank you for being my colleague for the last 2 years, I absolutely enjoyed working with you!

If you need any additional info, you are more than welcome to contact me.

__Maarten Schalekamp__
*DevOps at Mukuru*

`January 14, 2020, Riaan was senior to Maarten but didn’t manage directly`

Maarten is a wonderful colleague, he is very skilled and can pickup (and master) new technologies quickly. Maarten is highly skilled in Microsoft operating systems. He is extremely efficient with Powershell, and Puppet and he quickly gained an excellent understanding of AWS Cloudformation, developing Mukuru's infrastructure as code. I would highly recommend Maarten to any company, if you need any further information you are welcome to contact me. All the very best to you Maarten! See less

Bruce was the new guy in our team, but he quickly got down to business and within a few days he was pushing out complex Puppet code driven out of Hiera. Bruce also sunk his teeth into our Infrastructure AWS stacks driven out of Cloudformation code, and quickly managed to get familiar with it.

Theoretically Bruce knows the ins-and-outs of I.T systems and can get on top of things pretty quickly, I always appreciate a guy that can hit the ground running in today's fast moving I.T landscape.

As a person, Bruce is friendly and funny! I enjoyed working with him and would recommend Bruce any day.

You are welcome to contact me should you need more info.

__Gianluca Varisco__
*Chief Information Security Officer at Arduino*

`October 20, 2016, Gianluca was senior to Riaan but didn’t manage directly`

I've worked with Gianluca for about 4 years while I was at Rocket-internet - Gianluca was the VP of Security at Rocket-Internet. Gianluca kept us informed and up to date with security exploits and patches we should be aware of, and even helped us fix some problems that we could not manage ourselves. Gianluca is a highly skilled individual, especially when it comes to security and privacy and I would always recommend Gianluca! Besides that Gianluca is a great person, friendly, helpful, funny and strangely quite sociable, that said to this day I am still not 100% whether Gian is an advanced AI robot or an actual human being, I don't think he ever sleeps :) I wish Gianluca the very best for the future and any company working with him will most certainly be better off!

__Jürgen Weber__
*Lead DevOps Engineering at Whispli*

`November 7, 2015, Riaan reported directly to Jürgen`

Jürgen was the Global Team Lead for DevOps at Foodpanda and my direct superior. As my Team Lead, Jürgen was a pleasure to work with, technically he is extremely quick, very directed in solving complex problems and great at creating Improvement tickets for the future.

As a person, Jürgen was genuine and funny, and a thoroughbred Australian :)

During our time at Foodpanda the start-up earned $80 million in funding. Rocket-Internet shortly after invested an additional $500 million.

This fantastic financial support compelled us to create an infrastructure 100% in code, from Cloudformation, to Puppet and DNS, everything was in code, while auto scaling.

I would recommend Jürgen as a sound Team Lead, Infrastructure Architect or similar, he has in-depth knowledge and years of experience managing large scale infrastructure.

<hr>

__Tritika Sharda__ *Senior Project Lead*

`September 2, 2014, Riaan was senior to Tritika but didn’t manage directly`

Tritika Sharda, or T-Bird as she's known here at Foodpanda was our right hand lady here in the System Engineering team.

From the start I was impressed when I gave her a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) and she knew what to do with it 0.o

She is extremely reliable, and goal orientated, and I would recommend Tritika with full confidence.

As you can probably tell, I am not a native English speaker, there is no hidden code in this recommendation.

Tritika Sharda is a real asset to any technical team or organization.

__Timo Runge__ *Senior Solutions Architect Partner & Alliances at Amazon Web Services (AWS)*

`August 30, 2013, Timo was senior to Riaan but didn’t manage directly`

I have been working with Timo for slightly more than 2 years now, and it's my pleasure to write this recommendation.

Timo is a very hardworking, hands on Systems Administrator, with a very clear and direct way of communicating. Timo has a wealth of experience and is very much capable of handling all aspects of a fast growing eCommerce start-up with ease.

We have worked together on large scale eCommerce deployments such as Lazada (Asia's Amazon) Zalora, Zando, Foodpanda and countless more.

Timo is an early adopter of cutting edge technology, he is well versed in Puppet from Puppetlabs.com and has a firm understanding of DevOps.

I can recommend Timo as a valuable asset to any Technology driven company, he has a stunning personality, and a very honest outlook in difficult situations, which makes working with him an absolute pleasure.

Please feel welcome to contact me for more information.

__Malitlhare Nyenye__ *Information Technology Support Manager at SQLI SA*

`April 11, 2013, Riaan managed Malitlhare directly`

I met Malitlhare Nyenye while working at Zando.

In this rapidly growing environment where we went from 9 employees to 300 in 6 months, Malitlhare was my "right hand man" so to speak.

She recorded all new equipment diligently on Google docs and also managed all aspects of the companies email setup on Google Mail.

Malitlhare also helped with desktop support and her calming attitude and friendly smile made a big difference every day. The employees really took a liking in Malitlhare and also gave her a tea party at work when she fell pregnant with her first bay girl everyone contributed because we really valued her presence in the office.

Malitlhare is a very capable person in her duties, she is a fast learner and can work independently, she has a good overview of her work and she knows what has to be done without being told what to do, and I respect that attitude in my team.

I can with great pleasure recommend Malitlhare as a valuable asset in any company and team and wish her all the best with her bright future.

__Christoph Blau__ *Tech Lead TV Operation Center at Zattoo*

`June 20, 2012, Riaan managed Christoph directly`

Christoph is an excellent addition to any technical team, having worked with him at Zando, where the company grew from 20 to 300 in 4 months.

Christoph's work is accurate and he is a very quick learner who is able to embrace new technologies and use it successfully. During his time at Zando he mastered Windows Active Directory domains and VoIP and even started learning new technologies like Puppet, all of this whilst busy with an I.T degree from Unisa.

I was well impressed with his calm and relaxed attitude, and would gladly recommend him as an asset to any technical team.

<hr>

__Phumlani Nyati__ *Magento 1 & 2 / php Developer*

`June 20, 2012, Riaan was senior to Phumlani but didn’t manage directly`

I met Phumlani whilst contracting for Radical Company. Together with another developer we developed eCommerce enabled websites for www.mothercare.ie and www.elc-russia.ru - these are massive websites and not for the faint of heart as it's build on the Zend Framework using Magento EE.

Although Phumlani was fresh out of college when we first met, I was very impressed with his ability to handle the development tasks given to him. He had a "never say die" attitude and by the end of the projects I felt that he had gained a massive amount experience and new skills.

Phumlani is a very pleasant person, very accommodating and always willing to help out where ever help is needed.

I would recommend Phumlani as an excellent addition to any development team.

__George Rushby__
*IT Infrastructure Manager with 18+ years’ experience | Designs innovative Cloud computing architecture solutions*

`November 16, 2011, Riaan reported directly to George`

George, or "King George" as his co-workers call him was my direct manager at Viamedia
He has a "Never say die" attitude, and his attention to detail is impeccable

George leads by example and he's an asset in the scrum! Always willing to help out in the team when help is needed
. George dislikes laziness

He has a keen eye for detail, he's infrastructure documentation is impeccable, his server room is so clean you can do heart surgery in there.

It was a pleasure to work with George, he is more than capable of managing deployments of any size, he is a quick learner and early adopter of new technology.

George will be an asset to any company, and I can recommend George with the greatest of confidence.

__Bruce Blacklaws__ *Founder, App Evolved*

Riaan is an awesome person to work with and has an extensive and thorough understanding of all the current DevOps principals.

He is amazingly talented with technologies like Puppet and AWS CloudFormation and ensures a very high quality of work. I interacted with Riaan in person and online, both were very pleasant interactions.

You’d be a fool to not hire Riaan. I give him my highest recommendation.

Riaan is one of the smartest guys I've ever worked with.

__Jürgen Weber__ *Lead DevOps Engineering at Whispli*

`November 8, 2015, Jürgen managed Riaan directly`

Riaan is the most talented SysAdmin/DevOps engineer I have ever worked with. His quick whit, mind, intelligence, skills and ability to keep up with me made us a power house duo that I sorely miss. The amount of work we managed to accomplish in our 2 years together for foodpanda GmbH is astonishing.

Riaan's skills range from working with server hardware, networking, puppet, AWS, Cloudformation and his passion to ensure that the modern mentality of 'infastructure as code' is a reality make him an asset for any company.

If anyone is looking for a hard working, quick and reliable engineer then this is your man.

<hr>

__Johann Muller__ *Managing Director (and Founder) at Ace Snowboards*

`August 4, 2014, Johann was a client of Riaan’s`

Riaan's contribution and in-depth knowledge of Linux was certainly key to the success of our project. His sound advice and guidance on all things Unix - from everyday admin, through to security, and down to the hardware - was respected and appreciated. His attention to detail and enthusiasm gets things done - and done properly. Great team player and pleasure to work with!!!

__Dr. Hendrik Harren__ *Serial Entrepreneur & Data Scientist, Partner at DISRPTIVE*

`December 20, 2012, Dr. Hendrik was senior to Riaan but didn’t manage directly`

I had the pleasure to work with Riaan at Rocket Internet South Africa, which I was heading at that time. Rocket Internet is a startup incubator that launches several e-commerce ventures every year and Riaan was the senior system administrator of one of our ventures.

Riaan was one of the best hires we ever made. He is very skilled and energetic, solves any IT problem and is exceptionally reliable. In addition to keeping the IT in his fast growing venture up to speed, he helped out on other ventures (partly in his free time). Riaan is very well respected at Rocket and colleagues go to him with all their problems. He can translate complex IT problems in plain language so that non-IT experts - like myself - understand them.

When Riaan left the venture that he supported for almost a year, we made sure that he stays within the Rocket Internet family of businesses. I hope that he stays for a long time with our organisation as he is exceptionally gifted and a very good fit. I would recommend Riaan for any similar position. Do not hesitate to contact me for a reference.

As you can tell by now, I am not a native english speaker. There is no hidden code in this recommendation. Riaan is an exceptional person and employee.

__Marc Herbrechter__ *CTO / Entrepreneur*

`December 18, 2012, Marc managed Riaan directly`

Riaan has been leading the system engineering department of Zando in Capetown since the beginning of Rocket Internet GmbH's activities in South Africa. He was mainly responsible for the setup and maintenance of Zando and 5rooms.

Riaan is a very experienced system engineer and has excellent knowledge in all key aspects of this field. His main areas of work included managing the Linux based infrastructures which are driven by a complex puppet setup. The puppet certification enabled him to maintain and enhance this construct in a very helpful way.

Riaan is a very dedicated employee and goes great lengths to ensure optimal results.

Riaan will be leading the system engineering department in our tech centre in Portugal from 2013 on.

Riaan is a highly valued part of our Team of global experts and I would always recommend working with him!

<hr>

__Cillié Burger__ *Chief Technology Officer at TeleClinic*

`October 15, 2009, Riaan worked with Cillié in the same group`

I was impressed by Riaan's near limitless energy and passion for his
work, and to be completely honest, it was quite infectious. I think I'm still feeling the after effects a year later!

As a Systems Administrator he was dedicated, concise and solution focussed, with a flair for finding simple solutions to apparently difficult problems. He is a clear and direct communicator, and manages to state his arguments in a unambiguous manner. I recommend Riaan as an excellent addition to any organization's technical team !
